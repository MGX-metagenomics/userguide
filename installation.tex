\section{Prerequisites}

MGX is a client/server application based on the Netbeans Platform and implemented
in Java. To run the client application, the following dependencies have to be
met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Java Runtime Environment, 1.7 or later
  \item Java FX 2.x
  \item Supported Operating Systems: Linux, Windows XP, Windows 7
  \item Memory requirements: >= 256MB RAM
  \item a (preferably broadband) Internet connection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Java}

MGX requires a working Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on the computer. Typically,
Java is already installed on most systems or can be obtained free of charge from \\
\url{http://www.java.com/}.

The installed Java version can be checked e.g. at \url{http://www.java.com/de/download/installed.jsp}.

\subsection{Java FX}

In addition to Java, MGX requires the presence of Java FX 2.x, which is available as a separate
download from \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/index.html}.

\subsection{Supported Operating Systems}

The MGX application is developed and regularly used on Linux-based systems, but has already
successfully been used on computers running Windows XP and Windows 7.

MacOS ? OpenJDK (FX?)?

\subsection{Memory and disk requirements}

256MB of available main memory are sufficient to run MGX. Installation of the software
required about 60MB disk space.

\subsection{Internet connection}

The network communication protocol used by the MGX framework has been heavily optimized to
allow usage even with low-throughput connections. Thus, typical usage of the application
like visualization of analysis results does not require a lot of bandwidth, although
overall performance may suffer with high-latency or low-bandwidth connections. However, as
sequence datasets obtained by metagenome sequencing tend to be quite large, a broadband 
connection is recommended at least for initial data upload to the MGX server or when exporting
sequence data from a MGX project.
